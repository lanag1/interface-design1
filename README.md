# Interface Design 
> The purpose of my project was to make an app to make COVID-19 vaccination appointments. My app was made for the population of New York but could be applied to any state in the US. I constructed an easy to use app as this is a government service that will theoritically be used by the general population of New York would be using the service provided.
#### You can find the wireflow of the main feature of the app, creating an appointment for vaccination, [here.](https://www.figma.com/file/lwrlhWmROOkxfMUdKJW40Z/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1)
## Design Variation
> When I began to deisgn my app, I tried various shapes, fonts, and colorways to see which worked best on my homepage. I made sure to do this step first so the shapes, fonts, and colorways could be consistent throughout the app.
### Typography

#### I tried 3 different fonts from the Roboto font family on the main part of the homepage, the appointment button. I used 
### Button Shapes

#### I tried 3 different shapes for the appointment button. I tried a rectangle with 45 degree curves for the corners, a regular rectangle, and a rectangle with 65 curves for the corners. I found that the rectangle with the 45 degrees was most useful as the regular rectangle looked to harsh as a welcome, and the rectangle with 65 degree corners was too squished and the text was not as clear as the rectangle I decided on.
### Colorways

#### Above are my dark mode and light mode for the app. I decided that the light mode would be most effective.

#### I also contrasted checked all my colors on the app with their background to make sure that they passed the color contrast test. I also included the color contrast test for the baby blue I used for my buttons against black as black outlined all these buttons to make them visible and testing against the background would not give accurate results.
